      Technical challenges: Some challenges I encountered this week were getting some issues in <br>
      to Github and giving permissions for the coding files for our website. We overcame these <br>
      issues

      Technical challenges: Some technical challenges that we encountered were getting Github <br>
      integration for the CSAllenISD repository so that we can access it to push our work. <br>
      We also had trouble cloning the repository to our terminals for easy access. We overcame <br>
      this by using git pull and git config to fix the issue with git clone and we troubleshooted <br>
      the permissions for the CSAllenISD repository and we were able to access it after a bit. <br>
      <br>
      
      Scheduling challenges: We didn't encounter many of these challenges other than how we were <br>
      gonna communicate and work to get our project done at home. We fixed this by setting up a <br>
      group chat and making sure we were all staying on task and working hard. <br>
      <br>
      
      Interpersonal challenges: Didn't really encounter interpersonal challenges this week. We all <br>
      got along and were checking up on each other and asking for help, so I would say to keep doing that. <br>

      <br>
      

      <b> Software Engineer: </b> developing the technology for the application. Personally, with enough practice and knowledge, I would fit this role pretty good, and as long as <br> I overcome challenges like getting to work and debugging. For these challenges, I'll probably refer to my own resources, sources from others, and from the internet. I will also try and keep away distractions and stay focused at all times to fix these issues. <br>
      <br>
      <b> QA Engineer: </b> asking questions to check product. I would definitely fit this role, almost like a checker along the way making sure everything is working and in place before execution. Some challenges to this might be when I don't know
      <br> how to solve an issue or have too many to solve. To solve this I'll try and find resourceful info on how to fix it or get help from someone else. <br>
      <br>
      <b> Project Manager: </b> Managing the Github and organization and keeping stuff on track. As long as I know what to do with Github, I could fit this role too along with the others, since managing a Github looks pretty easy to do and is very interactive <br> especially for big projects like ours. Some challenges to encounter with this job would be if stuff wasn;t working and trying to integrate code to share with everyone, but with a few Github Docs and others to help me, I should get through them. <br>
      <br>
      <b> Product Manager: </b> Managing how the product will look. This one seems like the easiest, since you don't do much, yet it relies heavy on the person working to get the product out the door and as a final. Some challenges I could face are decision making <br> and checking for tiny errors, but these should be easy to come by with enough looking. <br>
      <br>
      <b> Release Engineer: </b> Managing testing and the release of the product. Same as the last job, this one seems easy to do but also relies heavily on the person to do their job correctly. Some challenges would be obviously debugging and deciding a good <br> release on the product. To get through these challenges, I would have to be very vigalent and watchful during testing and to think very efficiently, or get help when I most need it. <br>
