	<h3>
	  Project #1: Automated Garden <br>
	  By: Adhee Katru and Alan Roybal <br>
	  Accepted: yes/(no) <br>
	  Description: 
	</h3>

	<p>
	  This ISP is an automated garden in which you can take care of plants and help them grow. The machine that runs the project takes realistic weather patterns and events into account, like sunlight, storms and rain, and humidity, and so much more. I considered this because its a really good idea and could be made into a fun game. I decided to not go for this project because of the integration of the Raspberry Pi and how complicated the code might be. 
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Project #2: The Cafe Project <br>
	  By: Andrew Lin, Jake Podewils, Mustafa Shihab, and Sri Nagasai Siva Paladugu <br>
	  Accepted: yes/(no) <br>
	  Description:
	</h3>

	<p>
	  This ISP is an app that helps you get food faster at the Steam center. It allows users to preorder food from the cafe and then have them come pick it up later through and integrated application. It also has a sense of security requiring you to show identity when you pick up the food at the cafe. It will also helo lunch lines become much faster and shorter. I chose to consider this because it sounds like a really good idea that could actually benefit out school really well if it were to become reality, but I decided to reject it because working with the group would be hard, considering they are a different period than me.
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Project #3: Math Duolingo <br>
	  By: Devin Wingfield <br>
	  Accepted: yes/(no) <br>
	  Description:
	</h3>

	<p>
	  This ISP is an app that helps teach math to students and teachers with a similar system like Duolingo has. The main goal for the app is to be simple, interactive, and fun and also be effective in the system it is using to help teach everybody math. I considered this because it sounds like a fun idea and could be relatively easy to code certain functions, but I decided to reject it because I thought I could not complete the whole thing
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Project #4: Eagle Card <br>
	  By: Gaurav Jha and Aryan Kulkarni <br>
	  Accepted: yes/(no) <br>
	  Description:
	</h3>

	<p>
	  This ISP is a device which when held near a phone, prompts the user to open the web browser so that they can see the Digital Portfolio or anything else that is on the card. It is a very simple concept that integrates other technology we use everyday with it. I considered this because it would be contributing to our school and it seems like a simple idea, but I rejected it because I dont know if I can code something like that.
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Project #5: Smartshop <br>
	  By: Md Raeed, Isaac Pandyan, Kevin Li, Reynard Gunawan, and Avanish Jeendru <br>
	  Accepted: yes/(no) <br>
	  Description:
	</h3>

	<p>
	  This ISP is an application that helps you sort clothing items while shopping for them on websites to see your personal fit. This allows the users to try before they buy and see which one is right for me. I considered this because it sounds like a fun idea and simplistic yet useful to society and could be use on a range of websites but decided to reject it because it doesnt seem that great.
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Project #6: Drum Tester <br>
	  By: Juneyoung Hwang <br>
	  Accepted: yes/(no) <br>
	  Description:
	</h3>

	<p>
	  This ISP is an app that lets users test out drums before buying them. The app works with many different shops and stores to make a demo version of many drumkits to display to help customers choose the right drums. I considered this project because I love drums and the idea behind testing out different kits before the user buys is genius, but I ultimately deicided not to accept it because of the difficulty and the fact that getting resources for stores and drumkits might be challenging to port to Swift/HTML.
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Project #7: MyJob <br>
	  By: Mustafa Shibab <br>
	  Accepted: yes/(no) <br>
	  Description:
	</h3>

	<p>
	  This ISP is an app that basically works like a better job finder. The app helps students and adult find jobs nearby and has easy filters to use to better help them find the best job they need. The app will also be advertised in social media and have ads running for reveue. I considered this ISP because it sounds like a fairly easy concept and also sounds fun to make, but I decided to reject it because of the amount of jobs that might be available, so it would be tedious to try and get them all in one app.

	</p>
	
	<h3>
	  Project #8: Unblocked VPN <br>
	  By: Qasem Abdeljaber <br>
	  Accepted: yes/(no) <br>
	  Description:
	</h3>

	<p>
	  This ISP is about a VPN connection which unlike other connections doesn't get blocked on school wifi but instead unblocks itself from it and lets users access private browsing even on school wifi. This benefits the user's security and privacy when browsing the internet. I considered this idea because it sounds like a very beneficial idea and can possibly help not just students but teachers as well who want protection. I ultimately rejected this idea due to the difficulty of the project and trying to get it to work with the slow connections of the school wifi.
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>
	  Project #9: Bus Tracker <br>
	  By: Ryan Hallock <br>
	  Accepted: yes/(no) <br>
	  Description:
	</h3>

	<p>
	  This ISP is an app that tracks school busses and their arrival times, if they are late, and alternative busses. This system can be used to help students know which busses to go to and promotes better organization. I considered this idea because of the practicality of the app and how it can be very useful among students and drivers. I denied it due to issues with collaborations with the school system and trying to get it to work with busses.
	</p>
	
	<h3>
	  Project #10: Health Questionare <br>
	  By: Me <br>
	  Accepted: (yes)/no <br>
	  Description:
	</h3>

	<p>
	  This ISP is a website that hosts a questionare to the user to help them with their issues and mental status by asking personalized questions and using those inputs ot better understand the user, kind of like AI but a bit dumbed down for security reasons. It also has a friendly mascot to help users cope better with the website. I decided to go along with my idea since it would be very simple yet effective in the making and can also be beneficial in a way to help many get the help that they need through a simple questionare.
