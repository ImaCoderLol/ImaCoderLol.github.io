	<b> Intro <br></b>
	Starting to code in computer science can be a challenge for many, especially when it comes to big projects and debugging your own code. And along the way, you might ask some questions about what you are doing and what you are coding. These decision biases are frequent but can be solved. That's what's even happening in our ISP, when we are wondering who will do what and how we might fix the issues that come our way. Thanks to logic, we can fix these issues and we can get our ISP done with the right answers.

      </p>

      <p>
	
	<b> Paragraph 1 <br></b>
	Our first few questions come down to how we might stay on track making our ISP and how we might build and fix it, since it will be a complicated integration of Java in a web-based project. Things like debugging and actual knowledge of code are stuff we need to be thinking about, but how will we solve these problems? First, we need to take into account about how our ISP is gonna work and look. In summary, it’s a therapy website that will help users find the mental help that they need by having relatable question integrated into a questionare type prompt that is both informative and engaging The prompt is of course going to be built with Java and have lots of code built in to make it as useful as we can. So how do we get Java into a website and how do we fix it if it isn’t working?
      </p>
      

      <p>
	
	<b> Paragraph 2 <br> </b>
	Now that we have those problems fixed, what about the purpose of the ISP? Why do we want to make this and use up our time to make this project? We find ourselves asking these questions frequently, and eventually we had found the answer. No, it isn’t just so we can get things done. No it isn’t just for the grade (well, maybe). It’s really more for experience and design so that we can learn something new and utilize later on if we want to pursue careers in computer programming, and that we can look back on this and say that we did start young and that we did keep those lessons and that they were useful. We are also making this ISP so that maybe one day, someone will make our website into a real website for people with mental health issues so that it can be beneficial to many, or that we can do it ourselves if we could.
