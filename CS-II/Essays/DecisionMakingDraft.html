	Main ISP Plan <br>
	What We Are Making <br>
	Making a web based mental health/therapy session that anyone can access that is personalized by questions asked. The data collected is encrypted, anonymous, and either deleted for one time use or for later use when signed up. <br>
	What We Are Using <br>
	We are think about making this web-based with Java integrated functionality for deciding between responses from the user. The web-based part will be for design and integration.
	Main Problems and Biases <br>
	Problems <br>
	Some of the main problems that arose with the idea and development of this ISP were mainly based on practicality and functionality, things like how do we make it work with the integration? What about debugging purposes? Then we were wondering about things like getting on track to finishing the ISP before the deadline. Lastly, we wondered about the true purpose of the ISP and why we wanted to make it in the first place.

	Solutions <br>
	Some solutions to the coding issues can be to learn about integrating Java into a website through sources like W3Schools and GeeksforGeeks. We can also use the Project STEM courses to help us with coding the algorithm thatâ€™s gonna be within the website. And if we get really lost, we can always ask each other, ask others, or go to tutoring for a better understanding. For deadlines, we should make a teaching chart for things we have done (GANTT) and also keep tabs on each other and through messaging to get it all done. We can also reflect on our distractions and limitations to better suit our more useful needs to get the ISP finished. Lastly, for the purpose of our ISP, it would be to bring good advice and therapy for many in the perspective of younger minds and to make it easily available and easy to use, and to also learn some code and debugging along the way. <br>

	Conclusion <br>
	So in conclusion, as long as our group stick to the main plan, learns how to code and fix the problems in our code, and finish the ISP by the deadline, we should all be ok. <br>
