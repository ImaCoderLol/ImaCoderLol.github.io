        In a world full of hackers, scammers, and criminals its important to stay protected, and there's no better place to have security than the internet.
	And with easier ways for these criminals to take data from websites and servers, it's important for websites to enhance their users
	experience with HTTPS. HTTPS allows users to have security and privacy on websites, which also use Proxy Appliances which are    <br>
	sending/recieving protocols used for private communications and transactions between clients and servers. These websites can also use
	Certificate Authorities to give the browser information to see if the website is legit and not changed for the user. However, even with these security
	measures in place, not everything is so secure. For example, there are eavesdrops in websites called MITMS, or man in the middle. These
	browse the connection between a person and a website to collect information being sent or recieved, which can pose risks to the user like exposed
	information and possibly getting hacked/stolen from. There are also "fingerprints" and hashes that hide in website to make and track a specific series of code
	preset and unique to the user to collect specific information about you, hence the name. And just when it couldn't get worse, to hide all of this,
	third parties make different certificates that impersonate you and get them approved so that the user can use an altered version of the webpage
	to collect data. Even though it seems like there might not be any hope for true security, there are a few options to detect it, because unfortunately,
	there's not much you can do to prevent these activities. However, with certificates, you can alter the fingerprint just slightly, and the whole tracking
	system will be messed up, since websites can't duplicate certificates, and it helps to provide some more privacy. With all of this in mind, it also raises
	the question whether an organization, a school, or the government can legally eavesdrop on communications. In my opinion, I don't think they should
	unless given a valid reason to search mostly due to having pirvacy breaches for a student or individual without their consent. <br>
