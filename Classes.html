      ISP info: <br>

      Concept: Our group thought about doing a simple yet immersive game for out final project so we thought about doing a story based <br> game with immersive choices that change up your outcome and a story to hook the player <br>

      Motivation: We all got motivated to finish to project mostly because it was our final and we wanted to make it count and get a good grade <br> on it so we worked hard every day from things like the storyboard and layout to testing and coding <br>

      Problems and Solutions: Along the way there were some problems we had to solve, like some coding not working or issues with the storyline, <br> and to solve problems like these we had to either think outside the box or change it up <br>

      Features and Explanations: Some of the features of the ISP include a very intruiging story with suspense, twists and turns, choices, <br> and speical elements. It also includes code that makes the game more immersive <br> with the player and a smooth running experience <br>

      Conclusion: In conclusion, we got all the work done for our project and presented it to our class in casual outfits, describing the game, letting users test it, and letting people know we worked hard on it <br>


      What I learned in Comp Sci 1: <br>
      In Computer Science 1, I learned how to use merlin mission to do assignemnts and to use different programs to do those assignemnts, like Karel and IGIS. <br>  I also learned how to make a website, draw shapes, make functions, do tests, and learn about the different languages in comp sci and the backbones of how it works.
